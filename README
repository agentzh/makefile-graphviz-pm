Makefile-GraphViz version 0.11
==============================

This module uses Makefile::Parser to render user's Makefiles via the amazing
GraphViz module. Before I decided to write this thing, there had been already a
CPAN module named GraphViz::Makefile which did the same thing. However, the
pictures generated by GraphViz::Makefile is oversimplified in my opinion, So
a much complex one is still needed.

** IMPORTANT! **
This stuff is highly experimental and is currently at *ALPHA* stage, so
production use is strongly discouraged. Anyway, I have the plan to 
improve this stuff unfailingly.
